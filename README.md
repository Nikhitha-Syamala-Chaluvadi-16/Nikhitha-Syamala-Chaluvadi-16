# 👋 Hey there, I’m Nikhitha!

I’m a data analyst who’s passionate about digging into messy datasets, finding patterns, and turning them into clear, useful insights. Over the last 5+ years, I’ve worked with companies in **banking, healthcare, and consulting**, helping teams make smarter, data-driven decisions.

I use tools like **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL** on a daily basis—and recently, I’ve been exploring how to integrate **AI** and **cloud platforms like AWS and Azure** into my data workflows to work smarter and scale faster.

I don’t just build dashboards—I build stories people can understand and actually use.

- Creating dashboards that actually *answer* business questions  
- Cleaning and transforming data using **Pandas**, **SQL**, and **ETL pipelines**  
- Designing intuitive, interactive reports in **Power BI** and **Tableau**  
- Working with cloud data sources on **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Snowflake**  
- Writing clean, optimized DAX and SQL for scalable reporting
